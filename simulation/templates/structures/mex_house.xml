	<History>The Aztec Empire was a class society where differences between different social classes were strictly maintained. The nobles naturally had more privileges compared to ordinary people. Like everything else, there was a clear difference between Aztec homes for the nobles and those of ordinary people. The Aztec house for the nobles were stone structures that were spacious and well decorated. On the other hand, Aztec homes for ordinary people were relatively smaller and simpler. But several elements were also common among Aztec homes for nobles and commoners.</history>
