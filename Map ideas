My ideas for maps for the mod:
##Note: The maps will be from the old northern territories of Mexico to Patagonia

- Teotihuac√°n: A plain with an abandoned city in the center
The wonder is disabled in this map (The player has to capture the pyramid of the Sun of Teotihuacan, if he wants to win by wonder)

-Lakes of the Valley of Mexico: Similar to the great lakes of Age 3 but with small islands and some neutral villages and mountains in the left of the map, there is a possibility that the city of Tenochtitlan appears.

I'll add other map ideas later
